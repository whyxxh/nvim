# CONTRIBUTING? Thanks for the help <3
I love to enable people to contribute, and welcome suggestions and PRs! I do however have
strong preferences for the aesthetics of lackluster and I reserve the right to modify or 
reject any contributions as I see fit.

## LACKLUSTER GOALS
> These goals should be kept in mind when making a contribution :)
* Maximize code readability and minimize visual noise
* Make it easy to quickly visually identify...
  * Function and type definitions
  * Function return and exception points
  * Function calls
  * Builtin modules and functions
  * Diagnostic errors
* Support commonly used neovim plugins
* Be easy on the eyes

I've been trying to keep the non-code highlights (UI) darker gray and less colorful. I think it helps create a visual separation between code and UI, allowing the code to be in focus by being brighter and the UI to be darker but visible enough to be useful if you need to pay attention to it. My goal is for code to stand out and UI to sort of fade into the background, but still be useful :)

## Bugs 
If you find a bug please open a ticket :) If the issue is color related, please include a
screenshot.

## Spellcheck
I'm super dyslexic, and do my best with spellcheck, but that only works so well. So if 
you find a spelling error free to directly open a PR, no need to create an issue first :)

## Suggestions, Feature Request, General Input
If you have some input or a feature request, please open a discussion issue before opening a PR.
I'm open to new Ideas I just want chat about them first.

## Contributing New Features Process
1) Open A `Contribution Proposal` ticket an let me know what you want to work on :)
2) Get an Approval
3) Make your feature and open a Pull Request
4) Get a review, and potentially be asked for a few changes
5) Get merged!!!

Your the best! Thanks so much for contributing!

#### What To Put In your feature Pull Request?
A description of you feature, and a screenshot of what it looks like on your machine.

If you are adding support for a new plugin/extra tool, please add a code block containing
the your configuration for that plugin/tool so that I can test it out easier :)

## TODO / GREAT FIRST ISSUE
I plan on slowly adding support for the following tools, and would love help if anyone is
interested in contributing :)

I don't use these plugins so I makes it quite a bit of work to implement my self, so this
will probably be a slow long term effort.
