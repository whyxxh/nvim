# WARN: EXTRAS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
> all the extras are under-construction and experimental

Extras are likely incomplete and inconsistent, and are not a priority for this project at
the moment.

## Help Wanted
If you find a bug feel free to open an issue, but I will likely be slower to patch extra 
issues because extras are not a priority at this point. If you want to patch it your self 
send your proposal in the Issue and lets discuss it :)

If you want to take a shot at creating lackluster themes for other software feel free to
contribute them here :)

Suggestions, Bug reports, and Contributions are greatly appreciated :)

## Stable-ish
* alacritty
* eza (formerly exa)
* tmux
